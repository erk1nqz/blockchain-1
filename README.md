## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology through the development of a command-line application. Key features include asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, user interface (CLI), hashing, and the implementation of blockchain core features such as blocks, transactions, and Merkle trees.

## Features

### Blockchain Application Development (60 Points)
#### User Interface (10 Points)
- Created a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the blockchain.

#### Hashing (5 Points)
- Implemented hashing using existing libraries to enhance data integrity.

#### Blockchain Core Features (30 Points)
- Implemented blocks and transaction management, including adding blocks and transactions.
- Implemented a Merkle tree for efficient transaction verification.

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: Contains the all logic for interacting with the blockchain.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository using the provided VCS link.
2. Run `main.py` to access the blockchain menu.
3. Follow the menu options to create accounts, add transactions, mine blocks, and explore the blockchain.

## Bonus Features
### Consensus Mechanism (50 Points)
- Teams can select and implement either Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW) as the consensus mechanism.

### Mining Process (50 Points)
- The mining process involves miners performing transactions and being rewarded by gas.
